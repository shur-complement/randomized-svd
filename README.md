# Randomized Singular Value Decomposition

An [nalgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra) compatible rust crate to compute the [Randomized SVD](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2019/01/17/randomized-svd/) of a sparse matrix.
It exposes a struct `RSVD`, and one function: `rsvd`.

Implements this algorithm:

# Further Improvements

This isn't going to be the most high-performance implementation, but it is easily modifiable for anyone as the implementation is so simple.
Feel free to copy-paste any code, or submit PRs.

# Support

If you need any changes, open an issue and it will be addressed.
